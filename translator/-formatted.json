He was tall, slim and always\nelegantly dressed. His mother had given him a passion for clothes and at\nsixteen, he decided to become a fashion designer. He was now twenty-nine\nand good at his job.\nBut he was ambitious and he wanted to be the best.\nAt 9.15 he walked into the offices of his latest employer, Folly\nFashions.\nNorma Folly was the owner of Folly Fashions, the fashion house she\nhad set up thirty years ago.\nShe was fifty-two years old but looked younger. She had blonde\nhair, wore lots of make-up and liked to wear the latest fashions. Her dream\nwas to have the most successful fashion house in Britain. She wanted\neveryone to know the name Folly Fashions.\nNorma was not a happy woman. She was reading the front page of\nthe newspaper Business World.\nThe more she read, the angrier she became.\nShe heard voices coming from reception.\nShe got up, opened the door and saw her new designer laughing and\njoking with the secretary.\n\"Good morning, Cristian. I see that, as usual, you are working hard.\nIn my office - NOW!\"\n",

The show is on 19th March\nso you've got less than three weeks to produce all the designs.\" She glared\nat Cristian and waited for an answer.\n\"Don't worry, Norma. Everything is under control.\nI just need a few more dresses to finish the collection.\" He noticed\nthe newspaper on her desk. \"What are you reading, your horoscope?\" he\njoked.\n\"Cristian, don't forget that I'm the boss. Now, what do you know\nabout Laura Crane?\" she asked.\n\"I hear she's quite successful,\" he replied.\n\"Certainly more successful than you. She works for her father at\nCrane Creations, our biggest rivals. In this week's issue of Business World\nthere's an article about her. They call her 'the new face of fashion'. Listen to\nthis...\" Norma began to read from the article: 'Crane Creations has a new\ndesigner, the turnover is up by 35 percent and profits are increasing. They\nnow receive orders from all over Europe, they make clothes for famous\npeople, they are preparing their best autumn-winter collection...'\nCristian interrupted her to say: \"OK, OK, I understand.\"\n\"No, you don't,\" shouted Norma. \"At Folly Fashions the turnover is\ndown, our profits are decreasing and we have had only three orders from\nour last catalogue. Every month I have to delay payments to suppliers and\nall I get from you are expense claims. I want to be bigger and better than\nCrane Creations. So, what are you going to do about it?\"\n",

Her long brown hair was tied at the back of her neck\nand she too was well-dressed.\nShe preferred to wear trouser suits and silk blouses.\nShe said: \"This has been a great year for us. If you look at these\ngraphs you will see that sales, turnover and profits have all increased\nsharply. This is due to the hard work and effort of all employees at Crane\nCreations. Things are going so well that we have decided to launch some of\nour designs on the American market.

Norma's fashion shows are always\nentertaining but the designs are never exceptional.\"\n\"If we knew the identity of her mystery designer, we would have a\nbetter idea of what to expect,\" said Laura. \"He only exists in Norma's head.\nHe isn't real, but I am,\" said Manuel.\n\"Quiet!\" said Edward. \"It's starting.\" They looked at the TV screen.\nThe long catwalk came into view and the curtains opened. Norma Folly was\nstanding at the side, holding a microphone. In the audience she saw some of\nher regular clients, managing directors of big city stores, and buyers from\nboth the home and overseas markets.\nIf all went well tonight, Norma expected to receive a lot of enquiries\nand orders for her new range. She welcomed everyone, the music starred\nand the models began to walk down the catwalk in front of the audience.\nThe designs were better than usual but nothing fantastic. Then the\nfinal three models appeared together. One was wearing a fairytale wedding\ndress and the others were wearing the most beautiful evening gowns\nimaginable. The audience applauded loudly.\n",

NOW!\"\n\"First, I'm going to phone Norma,\" said Edward.\nHe dialled her number and waited.\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Norma replied to Edward's\naccusation of theft. \"My new designer has created all the dresses.\"\n\"So, where is he? I didn't see him at the show!\" yelled Edward.\n\"Unfortunately he's in bed with flu,\" answered Norma just before\nshe hung up.\nLaura and Manuel ran to her office. Laura looked in her drawer. The\npink CD had disappeared. She switched on the computer. The file had been\ndeleted.\n\"Everything's gone,\" she whispered. \"If I had the CD,\nI could call the police. But now there's no proof.\" Manuel fainted.\nNorma entered her office and hugged Cristian.\n\"We've done it,\" she laughed. \"Everyone's talking about our new\ncollection...\" She was interrupted by the sound of the telephone. \"Good\nevening, Mrs Folly. This is Simon Robbins from the UK Post.\nCongratulations on a wonderful show. Could I interview you later this\nevening? I'd like to write an article on Folly Fashions.\" Nonna tried to\ncontain her delight. \"If I had time, I would speak to you but I'm going to\ncelebrate my success with my staff.\" She arranged to meet him on Monday\nat 11 a.m. She had just made the biggest mistake of her life...\n",

Welcome to Folly Fashions,\"\nsaid Norma. \"I'm afraid I don't have much time as I'm haying my hair done\nat 12.30.\"\n\"What a pleasure it is to meet you at last, Mrs Folly,\" answered\nSimon. \"You're looking gorgeous today, as always.\"\nSimon knew that the best way to get information from Norma was\nto flatter her. \"What a great outfit! I'm not surprised you're in the fashion\nbusiness,\" he said looking at the elegant dress Norma was wearing.\n\"It's lovely, isn't it? I had it made by one of my designers. So, what\nwould you like to ask me?\"\nThey had spoken for more than an hour when Simon asked: \"Would\nit be possible to meet your new designer? I'd like to congratulate him on his\nsuccess.\" Norma was so happy that she agreed instantly. She phoned\nCristian and a few moments later, he came to her office. He shook Simon's\nhand and they talked for a while. Simon knew that he had seen Cristian\nbefore, but where? When Cristian refused to have his photo taken, Simon\nbecame suspicious.\nAs he got up to leave at the end of the interview, he saw some letters\non Norma's desk and he remembered. Cristian had been at Crane Creations\non the day Simon had interviewed Laura. But he had been dressed as a\npostman. What was going on?\n",

Mark Hill was right,\" he\ncried. \"This Cristian is Laura's new boyfriend, and now we know why.\"\nHe told Simon about the theft of the dresses. Simon asked\ncautiously: \"Are you going to tell Laura?\"\n\"Yes, WE are. But how?\"\nBoth men were looking worried when Laura came into her father's\noffice.\n\"What's up, Dad?\"\nEdward tried to explain George's deception to her. Naturally, Laura\nrefused to believe him.\n\"Dad, I know you don't like him but what you're saying is\nridiculous,\" she protested.\n\"I'm afraid it's true,\" apologized Simon. \"His name is Cristian La\nRoque and he's the new designer at Folly Fashions. I've just met him there.\nIf you don't believe us, why don't you phone him there?\"\nLaura picked up the phone, dialled the number and waited to be put\nthrough to Cristian La Roque. She felt sure it was all a mistake. Then she\nheard George's voice: \"Cristian La Roque speaking...\"\nLaura put the phone down quickly. She was shaking. She heard her\nfather's voice: \"I'm so sorry, Laura.\" Everything became clear in Laura's\nmind. George had always asked her lots of questions about Crane Creations.\nWhy had he wanted to know everything about their next fashion show? She\nwas sure now that he had sent the fax for the order of nylon and acrylic. He\nhad taken her keys and made a copy of them to get into her office. He had\nstolen Manuel's designs.\nHe had never been interested in her. He had used her. She said:\n\"Cristian and Norma think they have been very clever. Well, I'm going to\n",

He wanted to discover some more secrets from\nLaura and destroy Crane Creations forever.\nLaura greeted George warmly when he came into her office. She\nwas reading the latest copy of the UK Post. A photo of Norma Folly smiled\nup at her from the front page.\n\"Do you know anything about fashion, George?\" Laura asked him\ninnocently.\n\"Not really,\" replied George. \"Why?\"\n\"Well, I'm reading about one of our rivals in the fashion business,\nFolly Fashions. Their new collection has been a great success and they have\na new designer hut nobody has ever seen him. There isn't even a photo in\nthe paper. Don't you think that's strange?\" said Laura. \"I phoned Folly\nFashions and asked if I could speak to the person who created the new\ndesigns...\" Laura stopped to see the reaction on George's face but his\nexpression didn't change,\n\"... but the secretary told me that he wasn't in the office.\"\nSuzie, who was at her desk, giggled uncontrollably.\nLaura quickly asked her to go and get a cup of tea.\nShe didn't want George to become suspicious.\n\"I'm sure that your fashion show this weekend will be an even\ngreater success,\" lied George.\n",

Manuel has worked day and night to\nproduce some of the best designs anyone will ever see. He's created three\nnew dresses for the end of the show. Would you like to see one of them?\"\nShe led him to the comer of the office where there was a long line of\nclothes hanging on a rail.\nThey were covered in black plastic.\n\"These are all the dresses which will be part of the fashion show,\"\nsaid Laura.\nShe took the first dress in the row and uncovered it. She had to show\nGeorge that she wasn't lying. The dress was magnificent - a cloud of pale\nblue and white organza with tiny buttons that looked like diamonds. \"Isn't it\nbeautiful?\" she asked just as her father and Manuel came into the office.\nThey both pretended to be annoyed with Laura.\n\"Laura, what are you doing? I told you not to show the dresses to\nanyone!\" shouted Manuel.\n\"Yes, Laura. We must be vigilant at all times,\" insisted Edward\nCrane. \"Now, our press release was issued last week so all potential buyers\nknow when and where the show will take place. I spoke to the publicity\nofficer an hour ago and he told me that a celebrity from the world of sport\nwould be present on Saturday to open our show. He also said that some\nfamous names of pop music had asked him for tickets to see the show.\"\n\"Yes, such big names are coming to see my show... sorry, OUR\nshow. I can't wait.\"\n\"Ok, let's get back to work,\" said Edward. \"This show will definitely\nbe our best ever, won't it, Manuel?\"\nAs they left the office, Laura heard Manuel reply:\n\"Our show, MY creations!\"\n",

He said to himself: \"If Manuel hadn't\ndesigned some more dresses, this wouldn't have been necessary.\"\nHe opened the door to Laura's office and quickly went in. He turned\non the torch and went to the rail in the corner. Good! The dresses were still\nthere. George smiled. He put the two enormous hags he had brought on the\nfloor and began to fill them with the dresses. If Laura hadn't told him about\nthem, the show would have been a great success. She was so trusting and\nnaive.\nHe filled both bags, picked them up and began to walk to the door.\nAt the very moment he turned off his torch, the whole room filled with\nlight. He saw two policemen and behind them were Edward, Manuel, Suzie\nand, of course, Laura. For a moment no-one spoke.\nThen a policeman said: \"Don't move! Put the bags down NOW.\"\n\"Laura, I can explain. Please tell the police to go,\" cried George.\nHe moved towards her but again the policeman shouted: \"Don't\nmove!\"\nLaura came forward. \"I thought you liked me, George.\nIf you had told me who you really were, I would have understood. I\ntrusted you hut you betrayed me. You're just a common thief.\"\n\"A common thief,\" repeated Manuel. \"A thief who stole MY\ncreations.\"\n",

This scene was a great photo for the front page of the UK\nPost.\nLaura was crying. \"I've been so stupid! Thanks,\nSimon. If you hadn't seen George at Folly Fashions, he would have\ndestroyed Crane Creations.\"\nThe police arrested Cristian and took him away.\nOn Friday evening, it seemed like the whole world was present at\nthe fashion show for the new autumn-winter collection of Crane Creations.\nAs expected, it was a great success. Manuel and Laura were the centre of\nattention, and Edward Crane was happy to see his daughter smile again.\nSimon Robbins was also there and the next day the leading articles in the\nUK Post were about fashion. On the front page, there was a photo and an\naccount of the fashion show. At the bottom was an article describing the\narrest of Cristian La Roque and Norma Folly. The photo Simon had taken in\nLaura's office was next to another one of Nonna being arrested at her home\non Thursday night.\nLaura was reading the paper at home.\n\"Suzie, I'm never going out with another man.
